Cpython: 

Jpython: java based python. Forked by Paypal. Running it ontop on the JVM. Stuck on 2.7
Iron Python: Sponsored by Microsoft
Micropython: Python designed to run on microchips. Provides floating point and 64 bit integers with much stricker limitations. Can be run in 16 kb of ram. 
Pypy: Re-write cpython in python. The issue with this is that python is slow. JIT = Just in Time complier. Can be faster than python in certain situations, hot loops. 

Twisted: Networking library. async

1. Iterator and iterable
a = [1, 2, 3]
i = iter(a) # built in function
dir(i) #will list all attributes and methods of that iterator. We are looking for __next__
Check out __iter__ and all the special methods on the python3 

2. Next(..) built in function, .__next__()

3. raise Stopfunction
iterator protocol
1. iter(...) built-in function, .__iter__()
2. next(...) built-in function, .__iter__()
3. Raise Stopiteration 

read_lines() takes it into memory. 

Code can be an executable program or it can be a library. It takes on a dual nature. All of this can be done with __main__
