glob = *

**/*.py = recursively search through directory for all .py extensions. 

Cpython: 

Jpython: java based python. Forked by Paypal. Running it ontop on the JVM. Stuck on 2.7
Iron Python: Sponsored by Microsoft
Micropython: Python designed to run on microchips. Provides floating point and 64 bit integers with much stricker limitations. Can be run in 16 kb of ram. 
Pypy: Re-write cpython in python. The issue with this is that python is slow. JIT = Just in Time complier. Can be faster than python in certain situations, hot loops. 

Twisted: Networking library. async

1. Iterator and iterable
a = [1, 2, 3]
i = iter(a) # built in function
dir(i) #will list all attributes and methods of that iterator. We are looking for __next__
Check out __iter__ and all the special methods on the python3 

2. Next(..) built in function, .__next__()

read_lines() takes it into memory. 

Code can be an executable program or it can be a library. It takes on a dual nature. All of this can be done with __main__

I have played through this game a couple of times now, and I am really impressed with the depth of the story telling. I wouldn't characterize this as a video game, it really is immersive and interactive story telling. The VR is very impressive and maybe some of the best I have seen yet. I hope Blackthorn continues to churn out awesome content like this.

Fun watch: Andy Andres "Sabermetrics 101: Introduction to Baseball"

Pandas is great for ETL, takes out some of the human element. 

Pandas indexes: Pandas is a column oriented table set. Generally Postgres and others are row based. 

Database, ID, name, age, is_dead
	8 bytes, 32 bytes, 1 byte, 1 bit = 329 bits total. The semi-conducter companies come back and say you get 42 bytes. Eventually up to 44 bytes
	Matchine word - logical notion of a memory segment -> 8 bit bytes, 4 bit nibbles -> 16 bit words -> 32 bit words -> 64 bits

	This is all Row Oriented. It generally sucks

	NUMA - Non-uniform memory access. 

	Eventually it decided that things make more sense to be column oriented. An index is used which improves the memory usage. Contigeous vertical

	Numby is the underlying store in Pandas. Packs everything in nd-array. 

	slow: for row in df:
			t += row['is_dead']
	fast: t = df['is dead'].sum() -> popcount. Super fast! This is highlevel python code. This is actually faster than C 

	Numpy is written in fortran, not c! 

How would you write a query on pandas table where the age of the person is greater than 10? Something like this I think, filter_mask = xl_vals["Date"] < end_date. Why did they do it this way? 

B-Tree index: N-way tree, similar to a Binary Tree which goes 2 directions. 

Sql will build an index. This index will have pointers to rhe rows. Look up the is_dead bit and then add it. 

df[df['age'] >10]['is_dead'].sum() will return a bit array mask like [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0] for example. Builds smaller columns. This is optimized in hardware. 

Possible to make this go even faster! (df['is_dead'][df['age'] > 10]).sum()

Google creates a sparse matrix, they don't use row or column based dbs. 

DB browser for SQLlite: Think about how to model this data. Very different things in terms of what's actually possible. 

All databases are supposed to identity themselves by four properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability (ACID)

SQLlite: Very course, only one person can write at a time. MyIsam was the default for MYsql until 2009. Would only lock tables. Replaced by InnoDB which more ACID complient. 
Postgres has been the same throughout. If you ripped the powerout on Postgres, and plugged it back in, 

Sqllite: locks entire db. 
Myisam: Locks tables
Postgres: lock individual rows

There are other data stores which lock only single fields. Can result in dead-lock. 

Grant's code is on the dropbox: Check out zipfile, and pathlib. 

pre-check, skip-check, setup, work, cleanup, post-check 

Spark and Hadoop are both totally different style data bases. 


Checkout ipython as well, might be better for development. %history gives you everything you typed, copy and paste it in, re-factor into functions. 

%history ~2/1-100 (this is a magic command, %magic will talk about all of these)

ls will try to run this as python code, but if it fails, it will run the 'magic' version of it. 

def swap(a, b):
	a, b = b, a #tuple unpacking
	return a, b
dis.dis(sqa)

%timeit: superuseful. Creates complete testing environment, disables the garbage collector. It will run your code a million times. IF you have an an error in your code, you will watch that unfold. 

!ls = command in ipython. You can combine bash stuff, and python stuff! 

Feedback on the code: 
Use a with statement in order to close the connection to the db

Simulate a game of baseball! How would that work? Count RBIs, 4 bases. Most likely a poisson distribution. Bonus points for making this fast! How do you persist that information?
